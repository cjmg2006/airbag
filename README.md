## How to Run Code

1. Upload 'Manufacture' code into 1 Arduino  
	- File name: arduino.ino
	- Set line 87 to "Serial.println('w')"
	- Upload file to Arduino 

2. Upload 'Install' code into another Arduino
	- File name: arduino.ino
	- Set line 87 to "Serial.println('r')"
	- Upload file to Arduino 

3. Connect Arduino (w/ RFID readers attached) to computer 

4. Go to ./finalAssets/

5. Run server
	- In terminal, run "node server.js" 
	- Currently, server is running on localhost:8000

6. Open index.html in browser

## Hardware Assembly Instructions

1. Carefully solder pins from Arduino Stackable Header Kit onto the SparkFun Simultaneous RFID Reader - M6E Nano board
	- For detailed information on the SparkFun Simultaneous RFID Reader - M6E Nano including how to interface with it, check out this guide
	- Please note that the most important pins on the SparkFun Simultaneous RFID Reader - M6E Nano board are as follows:
		- RX (Digital 0), TX (Digital 1), Digital 2, Digital 3 - communication
		- Digital 9, Digital 10 - buzzer
		- 5V + GND - power

2. Gently mount the SparkFun Simultaneous RFID Reader - M6E Nano shield to the Arduino
	- Pins tend to bend easily, so ensure careful alignment

3. Plug the cables
	- Connect the Cable A to B - 6 Foot USB cable to the computer and then the Arduino
	- Next plug the Wall Adapter Power Supply - 5V DC 2A (Barrel Jack) into the Arduino

4. In the Arduino IDE, open the “Read_EPC” example sketch (File → Examples → Sparkfun Simultaneous RFID Tag Reader Library → Example2_Read_EPC)
	- Upload “Read_EPC”
	- Test with the Arduino Serial Monitor

5. Open our custom software (“arduino.ino”)
	- Upload
 	- Test with the Arduino Serial Monitor
 	- Follow the "How To Run" section


## Demo Setup Instructions 

1. If you would like to clear the local database, clear it by deleting finalAssets/db.json. The server script automatically creates an empty db.json file if none exists in the main folder.  

2. When you have an empty db.json, scan all 6 permutations of any particular airbag assembly into the Manufacture Arduino (labelled A). Since each bag has 3 tag, you do so by scanning each tag sequentially, for all possible sequences. 
- This stores the IDs of all possible scan orders into the database. 

3. Do not scan the airbag labelled B on the Manufacture Arduino - or it will record it as a legitimately manufactured airbag.
